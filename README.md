A Healthy Mobile Word Game For Your Brain Created With Flutter 

The Concept is quite easy:

- It's a word game
- When you tap the start button, it throws a bunch of words on the screen and the clock starts ticking.
- You try to memorize as many words as possible within the given time limit.
- When time is up, the app asks you which words showed up from the initial set of words, and the clock starts ticking again.
- As your level increases, the restricted time for memorization decreases and the word count increases.
